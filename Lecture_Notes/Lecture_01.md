### Lecture 1: Introduction to Computation

* [Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdFrWzyYoQg)

* [Basics of Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq5M5Gmf0do):
  * Fundamentally, a computer performs calculations and remebers the results.
  * A computer performs some simple primitive operations incredibely fast.
  * However we also need good algorithm design to efficently achieve our goals.
  * Some problems are still too complex for present day computers to solve e.g. local weather prediction.
  * Some problems are impossible for computers to solve e.g. [Turing's halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).  


* [Types of Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8T8AXxVFZg):
  * Two types:
    * Declarative knowledge: statements of fact
    * Imperative knowledge: how-to methods / recipes.
  * An algorithm is a sequence of steps to accomplish something.
  * Elements of an algorithm: calculations, test(s) and flow of control.


* [Basic Machine Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LfboDePVE):
  * Types of computers:
    * Fixed program computers: Perform a specific task e.g. calculator.
    * Stored program computers: Is able to store and manipulate instructions.
  * A program: Set of instructions built using primitives: arithmatic & logic, simple tests, moving data.
  * A special program (interpreter) executes the instructions in order.
  * Building blocks of a computer: memory, control unit, arithmetic & logic unit and I/O devices.
  * Turing showed that six primitives are summicient to compute anything ([Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)).


* [Programming Language Characteristics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYBjfMwpvzs):
  * Each programming language provides:
    * A set of primitive constructs - numbers, strings and simple operators.
    * Mechanisms for combining primitives to form more complex, but legal, expressions - syntax.
    * Mechanisms for deducing meanings or values associated with computations or expressions - symantics.There are two kinds:
      * Static symantics: Which syntatically valid strings have a meaning.
      * Full symantics: What is the meaning associated with a syntatically correct string of symbols with no static symantic errors.
