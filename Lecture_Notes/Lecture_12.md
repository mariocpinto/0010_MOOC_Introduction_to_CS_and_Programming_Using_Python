  * `pass` keyword is used when you do not want to define any special methods for a sub-class.

* [Generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoMVZbVRlZg)
 * Any procedure or method with a `yield` statement in it is called a generator.
 * Generators have a `next()` method defined which starts/resumes execution of the procedure.
 * The value returned is the value following the  `yield` keyword, except if the end of the mathod is reached, in which case the `StopIteration` exeception is raised.
 * A generator separates the concept of computing a very long sequence of objects, from the actual process of computing them explicitely.
