* [Measuring Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjk7yfFQCPI)
  * Goals in designing programs:
    * It returns the correct answer on all legal inputs.
    * It performs the computation efficiently.
  * Computational complexity:
    * How much time will it take for the program to run?
    * How much memory will it need to run?
  * Need to balance minimizing computational complexity with conceptual complexity.
  * To measure complexity, we use the concept of a random access machine:
    * Steps are executed sequentially.
    * Steps in an operation take constant time: assignment, comparison, arithmetic operation, accessing object in memory.
  * In order to factor for the variation in run times with changing inputs, one can consider best case, worst case and average / expected case.
  * In summary:
    * Measure complexity as a function of input size.
    * Focus on largest factor in this expression.
    * Focus on worst case scenario.
