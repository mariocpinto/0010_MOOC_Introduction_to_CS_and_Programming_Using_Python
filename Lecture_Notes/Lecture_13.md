### Lecture 13: Trees

* []()
  * Trees:
    * Trees consist of one or more nodes.
    * Nodes typically have a value associated with it.
    * Trees are convenient to store hierarchical data.
    * Nodes are connected by branches.
    * A tree starts with a root node.
    * Except leaves, each node has one or more children.
    * In simple trees, no child has more than one parent.
  * Binary Trees:
    * A special version of a tree where each node has at most 2 children.
    * Very useful when sorting and searching ordered data.
  * Sample implementation of a tree class.

* []()
  * Depth first and breadth first search.
  * Implementation of DFS and BFS.
  * Code to print path to a node.
  * Search in ordered trees.

* []()
  * Decision Tree: Special type of a (binary) tree, where at each node a decision is made.
  A positive outcome leads to the left branch to be taken and a negative outcome leads to the right branch to be taken.
  * Example of using a decision tree for the knapsack problem.
