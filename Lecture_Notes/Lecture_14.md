### Lecture 14: Wrap Up

* [Computational Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU8oz4ho6Dc)
  * Process of computational thinking:
    * Identify / invent useful abstractions.
    * Formulate solution to the problem as a computational experiment using abstractions.
    * Design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of the experiment.
    * Validate experimental setup.
    * Run experiment.
    * Evaluate results of experiment.
    * Repeat as needed.
    * e.g. complexity, recursion.
  * Three A's of computational thinking:
    * Abstraction.
    * Automation.
    * Algorithms.
